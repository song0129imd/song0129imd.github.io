        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Qing Song. I come from the Northeast region of China. 
            It is a small city with similar latitude as Ottawa. 
            The name of the city is called <strong>Liaoyang</strong>. 
            This year marks the 17<sup>th</sup> year that I lived in Canada. 
            I have lived in <mark>Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. </mark>
            I love the diversity each city has to offer. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My academic background is in finance. 
            I have always interested in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design" IMD.</abbr>
            I am so glad I made my decision and be where I am right now. 
            I have learned so much in less than a month. 
            There is one old saying from China 
            <blockquote>When there are three people you met, 
            one of them must be capable to teach you something.</blockquote>
            In my view, I realized I could learn something new from anyone I met. 
            I recently saw a TED Talk Show from <em>Sir Ken Robinson</em>. 
            He said<q>we grow out of creativity.</q> It suddently strike me. when we are little,
            we are curious about everything. 
            Eventually, we stop being curious which I feel is a bit sad. 
            I start to understand more that learning is a lifelong journey.
