        <p>Hi! My name is Qing Song. I come from the Northeast region of China. 

            It is a small city with similar latitude as Ottawa. 

            The name of the city is called <strong>Liaoyang</strong>. 

            This year marks the 17<sup>th</sup> year that I lived in Canada. 

            I have lived in <mark>Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa. </mark>

            I love the diversity each city has to offer. 

        </p>


        <p>

            My academic background is in finance. 

            I have always interested in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design"> IMD.</abbr>

            I am so glad I made my decision and be where I am right now. 

            I have learned so much in less than a month. 

            There is one old saying from China 

            <blockquote>When there are three people you met, 

            one of them must be capable to teach you something.<cite>Confucius</cite></blockquote>

            In my view, I realized I could learn something new from anyone I met. 

            I recently saw a TED Talk Show from <em>Sir Ken Robinson</em>. 

            He said<q>we grow out of creativity.</q> It suddently strike me. when we are little,

            we are curious about everything. 

            Eventually, we stop being curious which I feel is a bit sad. 

            I start to understand more that learning is a lifelong journey.
